# **Game Overview:**

In this strategic empire-building game built in **Java**, players commence their journey by selecting a historical city as the foundation for their empire. The ultimate objective is to assert dominance over the entire world within a specified number of turns. To attain this ambitious goal, players can strategically construct various buildings within their controlled cities and assemble formidable armies to conquer others.

## **Victory and Defeat:**

Success is achieved when a player conquers all cities within the game's designated turn limit. Failure is acknowledged if the player falls short of this conquest within the specified timeframe.

## **City Conquest:**

Each city is defended by its own army, necessitating the player to build a robust military force to overcome the defenders. Upon reaching a target city, the player can choose to either besiege it, attempting to starve out the defenders, or engage the defending army directly. The player can opt for automated resolution of battles or personally command units during engagements.

## **Resource Management:**

Two primary resources, gold and food, play a crucial role throughout the conquest. Gold serves as the primary resource for building construction, upgrades, unit recruitment, and maintaining the player's armies. Meanwhile, food is essential for sustaining the player's army, with soldiers consuming varying amounts each turn. Inadequate food results in gradual depletion of the army until sufficient provisions are secured.

## **Building Infrastructure:**

Players have the capability to construct diverse types of buildings to facilitate their world-conquering aspirations. Economic buildings contribute to the expansion of the player's economy and provision of ample food supplies for the army. Military buildings are instrumental in recruiting and training various units for the player's armies. Buildings can be upgraded to augment their effectiveness, with higher levels yielding superior outcomes.
